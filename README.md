# Windows 10 Config and Set Up

I have Asus G14, and it would be a waste if I installed archlinux, Im already happy with my Huawei Matebook 13 with Arch So, So I force myself to Re-Config My Workflow for Windows

## WSL Arch
> Seriously Im an Arch User , lose in Windows

## Powershell
> I hate to use CMD , i dont wanna use git-bash on windows cause it sucks, i might as well learn powershell 

## VSCODE
> Configure to Be Used with Neo Vim, Productivity Over 9000! Lol

## Alacritty
> I love using st terminal, but since only alacritty can be used on windows there you have it!

## Powertoys
> No Tiling Window Manager It Sucks , but powertoys meh but still worth than nothing

## Choco, Scoop, Winget
> Still Pacman is the Best Package Manager out there, But I hate going to Website and Download Stuff
